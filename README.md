The study on the machine learning algorithm (to be included in the digital twin) can be found in both the pdf "**IoT_MachineLearning_Davide_Cantoro.pdf**" and the nootebook "**IoT_Heart_Machine_Learning.ipynb**".

The difference between pdf and nootebook is that the pdf has been organised as if it was a _paper_ and has been reduced by many repetitive codes.

The notebook **IoT_Heart_M_L__with_duplicated.ipynb** on the other hand is a utility notebook, and was used to extract values used in the main notebook.

# Prerequisites
Python3 and the following libraries are required to re-run the experiment locally:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
