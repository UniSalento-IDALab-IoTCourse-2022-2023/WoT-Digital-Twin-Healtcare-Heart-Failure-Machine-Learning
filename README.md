# M.L. Treaning
In this folder are all the necessary files that showing how the algorithm was chosen and trained.

The study on the machine learning algorithm (to be included in the digital twin) can be found in both the pdf "**IoT_MachineLearning_Davide_Cantoro.pdf**" and the nootebook "**IoT_Heart_Machine_Learning.ipynb**".

The difference between pdf and nootebook is that the pdf has been organised as if it was a _paper_ and has been reduced by many repetitive codes.

The notebook **IoT_Heart_M_L__with_duplicated.ipynb** on the other hand is a utility notebook, and was used to extract values used in the main notebook.

## Prerequisites - M.L. Treaning
Python3 and the following libraries are required to re-run the experiment locally:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

# M.L. Backend
The backend that enables the daily execution of the machine learning model is located in "ml_backend" folder.

# Prerequisites - M.L. Backend
Python3 and the following libraries are required to re-run the experiment locally:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- schedule
- time
- warning
- pymongo
- requests
